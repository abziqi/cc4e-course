# 90-Day Measurement Framework
**Basecamp Coffee — Coffee Personality Quiz Pilot**
**Start date:** March 2026

## What We're Trying to Prove

The quiz gives the loyalty program a personality. Members who take it should stay longer, engage more, and feel like the program knows them. These metrics show whether that's happening.

## The Numbers We're Tracking

### Primary (show leadership)

| Metric | Baseline | 30-day target | 90-day target |
|--------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Quiz completion rate | — | 40% of visitors | 60% of visitors |
| 30-day retention | 27% | 35% | 50% |
| 90-day retention | 14% | — | 28% |
| Monthly active users | 2,100 | 3,500 | 6,000 |
| Program NPS | 12 | 25 | 45 |

### Secondary (show the quiz is working)

| Metric | What we want to see |
|--------|---------------------|
| Members who took quiz vs. didn't | Quiz-takers retain at 2x the rate |
| Repeat visits after quiz | Members visit again within 14 days |
| Drink recommendation clicks | 30%+ of quiz completers tap their recommended drink |
| Tier progression | Members who took quiz move up tiers at higher rate |

### ROI (the one leadership cares most about)
- **Baseline:** 0.5 (approaching negative)
- **90-day target:** 1.2+
- **How:** More active members → more visits → more spend per visit (personalized recs drive upsell)

## How We'll Know It's Working (Early Signals)

Look for these in the first 30 days — they're leading indicators before retention data has time to build:

1. **Quiz completion rate above 40%** — people find it worth finishing
2. **Social shares** — members sharing their personality type organically
3. **Return visit within 14 days** — the quiz created a reason to come back
4. **Barista feedback** — are personality types helping at the counter?

---

## How We'll Know It's Not Working

If by day 45 we see:
- Quiz completion rate below 25%
- No difference in retention between quiz-takers and non-takers
- Program NPS still below 20

Then we need to revisit the quiz questions or the result experience — not abandon the concept, but iterate.

## What to Show Leadership at 90 Days

Three numbers, one story:

> "Members who took the quiz retained at [X]% vs. [Y]% for those who didn't. Monthly active users are up [Z]%. Program NPS moved from 12 to [N]. The quiz is working — here's what we do next."
