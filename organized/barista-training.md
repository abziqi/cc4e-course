# Barista Training: Coffee Personality Quiz
**Basecamp Coffee — All Locations**

---

## What's Happening

We're officially launching the Coffee Personality Quiz as a permanent part of Basecamp Rewards. Members take a 6-question quiz and discover their coffee personality type. Your job is to make that feel real at the counter.

This isn't a new app feature to explain. It's a conversation starter.

## At the Counter

When a member mentions their personality type (or you can see it in the app):

1. **Acknowledge it** — "Oh you're a Bold Adventurer, nice"
2. **Connect it to their order** — "That tracks, you'll love this roast"
3. **Suggest something new** — use the upsell line for their type

You don't need to memorize a script. Just know the four types and what they mean. The rest is the natural Basecamp conversation you're already having.

## If Someone Hasn't Taken the Quiz

Point them to the QR code at the counter:

> "Have you taken our coffee personality quiz? It takes two minutes and it's actually pretty fun — tells you what kind of coffee person you are."

That's it. No hard sell.
