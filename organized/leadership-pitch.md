# Basecamp Rewards: The Pivot

## The Short Version

We spent 6 months building a points program. Members sign up, visit twice, and disappear — not angry, just indifferent. The program has no personality. We're going to fix that in 90 days, at zero additional cost, by giving members a coffee identity they actually care about.

The quiz is already built and live. Here's the full picture.

## The Problem

Leadership invested $40K in Basecamp Rewards. Six months later:

| Metric | Launch | Today |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Monthly active users | 5,250 | 2,100 |
| 30-day retention | 45% | 27% |
| 90-day retention | 28% | 14% |
| Program NPS | 34 | 12 |
| ROI | 1.8 | 0.5 |

Sign-ups are up 122% — the program looks healthy from the outside. It's hollowing out from the inside. ROI hits negative within 60 days at this trajectory.

The root cause isn't the points structure. It's simpler than that:

> *"Your coffee has personality. Your rewards program doesn't."*
> — actual member feedback, April

## What We Found

Four months of research across member data, 10 past campaigns, 5 competitors, and 178 customer surveys all pointed at the same thing.

**Every campaign we've run was purely transactional.** Points for actions. Bonuses for compliance. Not one asked: *who is this customer, and what kind of coffee person are they?*

**Competitors who win don't sell discounts — they sell identity.**
- Dutch Bros: sticker culture, baristas remember your name
- Starbucks: Gold status, "insider" feel
- Roast & Co: coffee expertise, customers identify as "Ethiopian natural people"

**Our members said it directly:**
- *"I wish you could help me find new drinks to try."*
- *"I've been coming here 2 years but the app treats me like a stranger."*
- *"Generic. Could be any coffee chain."*

The gap: nobody in the market has built a coffee personality program. That gap is wide open.

## The Solution

**The Coffee Personality Quiz** — already built, already live.

Members answer 6 quick questions and discover what kind of coffee person they are: Zen Minimalist, Bold Adventurer, Sweet Enthusiast, or Indulgent Treat.

They get:
- A coffee identity that feels like *them*
- A signature drink recommendation
- Drinks to discover next
- Something worth sharing ("apparently I'm a Zen Minimalist — what are you?")

Baristas get:
- Personality type visible at the counter
- Instant context for personalization ("ah, you're a Bold Adventurer — have you tried our Kenyan roast?")

This required no new budget. Built on existing infrastructure in 2 weeks.

## The 90-Day Pilot

We're not asking for a full program overhaul. We're asking for 90 days to prove this works.

**Targets:**

| Metric | Today | 90-Day Target |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Monthly active users | 2,100 | 6,000 |
| 30-day retention | 27% | 50% |
| 90-day retention | 14% | 28% |
| Program NPS | 12 | 45 |
| ROI | 0.5 | 1.2+ |
| Members past Tier 1 | 11% | 20%+ |

**The leading indicator we'll watch:** Members who take the quiz should retain at 2x the rate of those who don't. We'll know within 30 days if the mechanic is working.

**Month 1:** Quiz live, first 500 completions, baseline data locked
**Month 2:** Barista visibility feature integrated, optimize based on drop-off data
**Month 3:** Full cohort analysis, NPS resurvey, report to leadership

---

## The Ask

Three things:

1. **Approve the 90-day pilot** — let the quiz run, measure against the targets above
2. **Resolve IT ticket #4521** — push notifications are broken, we need them to drive quiz invitations to existing members
3. **90 days** — if we can't hit four of six targets, we stop and reassess

We're not asking to rebuild the program. We're asking for permission to give it a personality.
