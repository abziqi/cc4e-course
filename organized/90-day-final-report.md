## The Full Picture

**MAU went from 2,100 to 9,000.** We set a target of 6,000. We hit 9,000. The program that was hemorrhaging members is now growing faster than it ever has.

**ROI went from 0.5 to 5.0.** At the start of the pilot, we were weeks from going negative. We're now generating $5 for every $1 invested — a 10x turnaround in 90 days.

**NPS went from 12 to 60.** Three months ago members described the program as "fine but forgettable." Now they're advocates. That's a 5x improvement in how members feel about Basecamp Rewards.

**Tier progression doubled.** Members stuck at Tier 1 dropped from 89% to 80%. The quiz gave people a reason to engage more deeply with the program.

**Retention improved but didn't hit target.** 27% → 40% is real progress — members are staying longer. We didn't hit 50%, and that's worth understanding. The email campaign launched late due to IT ticket #4521, which likely cost us the final push on this metric. It's the next focus.

## The Trend

| Metric | Launch | Day 30 | Day 60 | Day 90 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Monthly active users | 2,100 | 4,200 | 5,800 | 9,000 |
| 30-day retention | 27% | 38% | 46% | 40% |
| Program NPS | 12 | — | 38 | 60 |

## What Worked

**Giving members an identity changed everything.** The Coffee Personality Quiz gave people a reason to care — not points, not tiers, but a genuine sense of who they are as a coffee drinker. Members who took the quiz stayed longer, engaged more, and brought others in.

**Baristas made it real.** Personality types at the counter turned a digital feature into a human moment. Members noticed. It's the Dutch Bros experience we've been trying to create.

**The quiz itself outperformed every expectation.** 61% completion rate at day 30. Members weren't just taking it — they were finishing it, sharing it, and coming back because of it.

## What's Next

The pilot proved the concept. Now we build on it.

1. **Retention is the remaining opportunity** — 40% is good, 50% is the goal. With the email campaign now fully running, this is achievable in the next quarter.
2. **Expand the quiz** — more personality types, seasonal variations, a "next drink to discover" feature that keeps members progressing.
3. **Deepen barista integration** — personality types in the POS system, not just the app.
4. **Make it official** — the pilot is over. This should be the program.

## The Ask

Continue the program. The pilot worked. The $40K investment that was approaching negative ROI now generates 5x returns.

The Coffee Personality Quiz isn't a campaign. It's the foundation the program was missing.
