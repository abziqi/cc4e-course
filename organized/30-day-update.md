## The Short Version

Every target hit. Every one beat.

The Coffee Personality Quiz is working. Members are engaging, staying longer, and coming back. Here's the data.

## 30-Day Results

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Monthly active users | 2,100 | 3,500 | 4,200 | ✅ Beat by 20% |
| 30-day retention | 27% | 35% | 38% | ✅ Beat by 3pts |
| Quiz completion rate | — | 40% | 61% | ✅ Beat by 21pts |

**MAU doubled in 30 days.** We went from 2,100 to 4,200 active members — that's 2x the baseline in one month.

**Quiz completion at 61%** means members aren't just starting the quiz and dropping off — they're finishing it. That's a strong signal the experience is landing.

**Retention is moving in the right direction** for the first time since the program launched.

## What's Driving It

Members who take the quiz have something the program never gave them before: an identity. They know what kind of coffee person they are. They have a reason to come back and explore.

Barista feedback from the first 30 days has been consistent — personality types at the counter are sparking real conversations. Members are asking about their recommended drinks. Baristas are making personalized suggestions. The gap between the in-store experience and the app is closing.

## What's Next (Days 31–60)

- Push member email campaign once IT ticket #4521 is resolved — estimated 5,500 additional members to reach
