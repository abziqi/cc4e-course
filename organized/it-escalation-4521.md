# IT Escalation: Ticket #4521
*Push notifications broken — loyalty program*

**Re:** Ticket #4521 — Push notifications not sending

Hey,

Following up on ticket #4521 — push notifications aren't sending from the Basecamp Rewards app.

This just became time-sensitive. Leadership approved a 90-day loyalty program pilot this week, and our member outreach campaign is blocked until notifications are working. We're trying to reach ~5,500 disengaged members to invite them to take the new Coffee Personality Quiz.

Is there an ETA on the fix? If there's anything on our end that would help move it along, let me know.

Thanks
