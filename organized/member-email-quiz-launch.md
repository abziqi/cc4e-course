Hey there,

It's been a while since we've seen you, and honestly — that's on us.

We've been doing some thinking about Basecamp Rewards, and we heard you. The program has been a little... generic. Points and tiers that don't mean much. Nothing that actually feels like Basecamp.

So we built something different.

**Introducing: the Coffee Personality Quiz.**

Six questions. Two minutes. One coffee identity that's actually yours.

Are you a Zen Minimalist? A Bold Adventurer? A Sweet Enthusiast? An Indulgent Treat? Your baristas already have a sense — now you will too.

**[Find your coffee personality →](https://cc4e-coffeecourse.vercel.app)**

Once you know your type, we'll point you toward drinks you'll love, and your baristas will have a little more context the next time you walk in. Less "the usual?" and more "have you tried the Kenyan roast yet?"

That's the kind of program we should have built from the start.

Come find out what kind of coffee person you are. We think you'll like the answer.

See you soon,
The Basecamp Coffee team
