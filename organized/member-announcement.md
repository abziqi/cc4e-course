Hey there,

Something changed at Basecamp Rewards — and we think you're going to like it.

Over the last 90 days, thousands of members took our Coffee Personality Quiz. They found out they were Zen Minimalists, Bold Adventurers, Sweet Enthusiasts, and Indulgent Treats. They discovered new drinks. Their baristas got to know them a little better.

It worked. So we're making it permanent.

**The Coffee Personality Quiz is now a core part of Basecamp Rewards** — at all 45 locations across Seattle, Portland, and Boise.

Here's what that means for you:

- **Your personality type lives in your profile** — your baristas can see it when you check in
- **Drink recommendations are personalized** — based on who you actually are, not just what you ordered last time
- **There's always something new to try** — we'll keep surfacing drinks that match your type

If you haven't taken the quiz yet, now's the time:

If you have — your type is already in your profile. Next time you walk in, your barista might just surprise you.

See you soon,
The Basecamp Coffee team
