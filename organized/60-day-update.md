## The Short Version

On track across the board. One month left to close the gaps — and they're small.

## 60-Day Results

| Metric | Baseline | 90-Day Target | Day 60 | Gap to Target |
|--------|----------|---------------|--------|---------------|
| Monthly active users | 2,100 | 6,000 | 5,800 | 200 |
| 30-day retention | 27% | 50% | 46% | 4pts |
| Program NPS | 12 | 45 | 38 | 7pts |

**MAU is at 5,800** — up from 2,100 at launch. We need 200 more in the final 30 days.

**Retention at 46%** — nearly double the baseline. 4 points away from target.

**NPS tripled.** From 12 to 38 in 60 days. Members who were indifferent are becoming advocates.

## The Trend

| Metric | Launch | Day 30 | Day 60 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Monthly active users | 2,100 | 4,200 | 5,800 |
| 30-day retention | 27% | 38% | 46% |
| Program NPS | 12 | — | 38 |

Every metric is moving in the right direction, every month.

## What's Driving the Final Push

The member email campaign is now running. An estimated 5,500 disengaged members are being reached for the first time — this is the remaining growth opportunity heading into day 90.

Barista feedback continues to be positive. Personality types at the counter are driving real conversations and upsells. Members are asking about their recommended drinks by name.

## Month 3 Focus (Days 61–90)

- Email campaign driving new quiz completions from previously unreached members
- Final NPS push — members who took the quiz early are now 60+ days in, prime for advocacy
- 90-day retention read: first full cohort completing the measurement window
- Full cohort analysis: quiz-takers vs. non-takers on retention and spend

## Outlook for Day 90

The gaps are small and the email campaign is running. Hitting all six targets by day 90 is realistic.

More at day 90 — with the full cohort analysis.
